## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does `strictly equal` mean?

The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

- What is the logical **and** operator?

The && operator in JavaScript is the logical AND operator. It combines multiple conditions and returns true only if all of the conditions are true. If any of the conditions is false, the operator returns false.

- Can you name some comparison operators?

1. Equality Operator (===) aka strict equality
2. Inequality Operator (!==) aka strict inequality
3. Greater Than Operator (>)
4. Less Than Operator (<)
5. Greater Than or Equal To Operator (>=)
6. Less Than or Equal To Operator (<=)
