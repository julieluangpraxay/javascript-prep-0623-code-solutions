## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What data types can object properties hold?
  JavaScript has 8 Datatypes

1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

- Describe the syntax (structure) of object-literals in JavaScript.

Object Declaration: The object literal begins with the keyword const (or let) followed by a variable name of your choice, followed by an equals sign =.

Curly Braces: The object literal is enclosed within curly braces {}.

Properties and Values: Inside the curly braces, you define properties and their corresponding values. Each property consists of a name (also called a key) followed by a colon : and then the associated value. Multiple properties can be separated by commas.

Property Names: The property names can be either strings or valid identifiers. If the property name is a valid identifier (e.g., no spaces or special characters), it can be written directly without quotes. If the property name includes spaces or special characters, it should be enclosed in quotes (single or double).

Property Values: The property values can be of any valid JavaScript data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, other objects, functions, etc.
Example:

const person = {
name: Julie
age: 27
};

console.log(person);
}
