## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does the `=` (equals) operator do in JavaScript?
  The = assigns and does not actually mean equal like it does in algebra. "In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
  This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:
  x = x + 5
  In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.
  (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5"
- What operator will return the data type of a variable value?
  You can use the typeof operator to find the data type of a JavaScript variable. Typeof allows you to find out the data type of a value stored in a variable. It returns a string that represents the data type of the value.

- Which keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript?
  the "var" keyword is used but is outdated. The more common keywords for variable declaration is "let" and "const".
  The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
  The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
  The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

- Which characters is a JavaScript variable allowed to begin with?
  They can begin with letters that are lower or uppercase. They can also begin with underscores "\_" and dollar signs $ in certain cases.

- What are quotation marks used for in JavaScript?
  Quotation marks are used for strings to ditinguish them from other code elements. Apparently '' and "" is used interchangeably to define strings but you should use one way and be consistent throughout your code.

- What is the purpose of strings in JavaScript?
  Strings are fundamental in JavaScript for storing, handling and manipulating text data, enabling communication, data storage, user interaction, and various other operations involving text-based information.

- What is the purpose of booleans in JavaScript?
  A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.
  You can use the Boolean() function to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true.
  Booleans are fundamental in JavaScript as they enable decision-making, control flow, and logical operations in a program. They allow developers to create dynamic and flexible code that can adapt based on the truth value of different conditions.
  Everything With a "Value" is True
  Everything Without a "Value" is False

- What is the purpose of numbers in JavaScript?
  Numbers are a fundamental data type in JavaScript, enabling numeric calculations, comparisons, iterations, data manipulation, and other mathematical operations. They play a crucial role in many areas of programming, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematical computations and data processing tasks

- What does `null` mean in JavaScript?
  So, null is a special way in JavaScript to say that something intentionally doesn't have any value or that it's empty on purpose. It's like having an empty box and being perfectly fine with it being empty for a specific reason.
